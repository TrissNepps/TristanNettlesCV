    <h3>Education:</h3>
    <p><strong>University of North Florida,</strong> <em>2015</em></p>
    <p>In January 2013, I transferred to the University of North Florida where I continued
      my studies in biology and in particular, coastal biology. Research conducted
      during my time at UNF centered on the role of viral protein 30 in the transcription
      of the Ebola Virus. This research was conducted under the tutelage of Dr.
      Michael Lentz, the department head of Molecular and Cell Biology at UNF. As
      well as my coursework I also founded and organized the first 3D Printing club in
      North Florida. UNF3D became the second largest student organization, behind

      only Student Government, on university campus while I served as President. I
      graduated from the University of North Florida in July 2015.</p>

    <p><strong>Florida State College at Jacksonville,</strong><em> 2012</em></p>
    <p>I attended Florida State College Jacksonville from August of 2011 until
      December of 2012 in order to complete the required coursework for an
      Associates of Science Degree. Upon conferment of this degree, I applied for and
      received admittance to the University of North Florida where I began work
      towards my Bachelors of Science in Biology.</p>
